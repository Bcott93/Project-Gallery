# Project-Gallery - Founders & Coders

As part of my application to join the Founders & Coders apprenticeship, I have built a gallery to show the projects I have been working on.

## The Goal

The goal was to create a gallery showcasing the skills I have which make me a viable candidate for the apprenticeship. I have included projects from both this application, and my previous bootcamp. 

## Requirements

The requirements for the page were:

    - Have a section or card for each project
    - Each card should have a title, an image of your project, and a description
    - Use flexbox to arrange the cards on the page,
    - Resize cards based on screen width,
    - Adapt the layout of the gallery when the browser window resizes
    - Display the cards in a single column on mobile devices
    - Have a clickable button on each card that opens and closes the description text.

## How did I make the site?

### Planning

Initially I looked into manipulating flexboxes to meet the responsiveness of the challenge, as the majority of the technical requirements are to do with how the boxes interact with display resolution. 

Once I was confident I knew how to do that, the rest was using my GitHub repo to import the data required to create a polished final product.
